                <h2>Ukraine and Russia trade blame over fire at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant </h2>
                <p>Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other after a fire broke out at the giant Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Sunday.
                    Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian forces had started a fire at the plant, which has been occupied by Moscow's forces for more than two years. Zaporizhzhia's Kremlin-installed governor said Ukrainian shelling caused the blaze.
                    The UN's nuclear watchdog said it saw "strong dark smoke" coming from the facility - but said there was "no impact reported" for nuclear safety.
